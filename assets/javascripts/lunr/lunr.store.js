        "excerpt":"A simple yet fully customizable way to run functions iteratively in R using multiple CPU cores (instead of the default, one) by bridging purrr to foreach package and its adapters. With parapurrr, one can run purrr’s mapping functions in parallel (i.e., incorporate multiple CPU cores instead of the default, one). The package parapurrr does that by connecting purrr to foreach package and its adapters. Users are only required to add a prefix “pa_” before their desired purrr functions (e.g., pa_map instead of map). The rest will be handled internally. All map family functions and all foreach adapters on CRAN are supported. Please see the parapurrr’s vignette article for additional information, including FAQs and detailed instructions on fully tailoring the parallelization process. ","categories": ["R Packages"],

        "excerpt":"Part of a projects series conducted in the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization with the primary goal of introducing blood transfusion waste products as a sustainable and economic source of bio-molecules and cells. This is particularly important in under-developed countries where fundings and resources are limited. We have investigated if the used leukocyte reduction filters, a by-product in the blood transfusion practice that currently is considered wastes, can be utilized as a source of NK cells. Our results shows that the used leukocyte reduction filters can be considered as an economic, easy to obtain, and robust source of abundant research-grade NK cells. Every major leukocyte population was abundant in the samples extracted from the used leukocyte reduction filters. The NK cells extracted from leukocyte reduction filters with our proposed workflow did not show any statistically meaningful differences from peripheral blood samples in terms of sub-populational composition, viability, degranulation potency, and cytotoxic capacity.

        "excerpt":"The goal of rbioapi is to provide a user-friendly and consistent interface to biological databases and services: In a way that insulates the user from technicalities of using web services API and creates a unified and easy-to-use interface to biological and medical web services. Currently rbioapi fully supports Enrichr, JASPAR, miEAA, PANTHER, Reactome, STRING, and UniProt. With rbioapi, you do not need to have technical knowledge about web services API or learn how to work with a new package for every biologic service or database. This an ongoing project; New databases and services will be added periodically. Feel free to suggestany databases or services you often use.
