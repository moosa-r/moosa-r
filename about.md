Hello!

I consider (and aspire to further develop) myself as a hybrid species, wandering in the realms of Cell Biology and Immunology Laboratory works, as well as Computational and Systems biology. 

I studied Cell and Molecular Biology as an undergraduate, then, obtained a master's degree in Medical Immunology.

Now, I'm working as a PhD student in [David Vermijlen's lab](https://u-cri.ulb.be/index.php?action=researchGroups&group=10) at [ULB Center for Research in Immunology (U-CRI)](https://u-cri.ulb.be/) in Brussels, where I'm researching an immune system's cell type called _γδ T cells_.

I would love to connect and collaborate; here are the places where you can find me:
