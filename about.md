Hi!

I consider (and aspire to further develop) myself as a hybrid species, wandering in the realms of Cell Biology and Immunology Laboratory works, as well as Computational and Systems biology. 

I majored in Cell and Molecular Biology as an undergraduate. Later on, I pursued a master's degree in medical immunology. Now, I'm starting a quest for a Ph.D. in Immunology program.

I would love to connect and collaborate; here are the places where you can find me:
