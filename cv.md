## Researches and Projects

  * **Disturbances in NK Cells and Tumors&#39; Protein-Protein Interaction Network, a Pan-Cancer Analysis**
    * 2019-Present
    * This is still an unpublished project.
<br> <br>
  * **Establishing Blood Transfusion waste products as a source of NK cells (Part of M.Sc. Thesis)**
    * 2017-2019
    * Our project was part of a series conducted by the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization to introduce blood transfusion waste products as a sustainable and cost-effective source of bio-molecules and cells. This is particularly important in under-developed countries where fundings and resources are limited. Methods including flow cytometry, immune cells isolation, ELISA, cell culture, and killing assays were used. NK cells obtained by our approach is comparable to peripheral blood’s NK cells in term of viability, Sub-populational composition, and function.

  * **rbioapi: User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services&#39; API**
    * 2020-2021
    * Open-source R package software
    * Links:
        * [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rbioapi)
        * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moosa-r/rbioapi)
	    * [Documentations Website](https://rbioapi.moosa-r.com/)
    * The R package, rbioapi, is an interface to biological and medical databases and web services. This package provides consistency, a smooth learning curve for the users, and scalability for the developers. To date, rbioapi fully supports Enrichr, JASPAR, miEAA, PANTHER, Reactome, STRING, and UniProt. I aim to expand this list and make rbioapi as comprehensive as possible by inviting collaborations and contributions.
<br> <br>
  * **parapurrr: Do purrr in Parallel**
    * 2021
    * Open-source R package software
    * Links:
        * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moosa-r/parapurrr)
    * The R package, parapurrr, offers a simple yet fully customizable way to iteratively run functions in R using multiple CPU cores (instead of the default, one). The package parapurrr deliver that by bridging purrr to foreach package and its adaptors. All of purrr’s mapping functions and every foreach adaptor available in CRAN are supported.
