## Researches and Projects

  * **Disturbances in NK Cells and Tumors&#39; Protein-Protein Interaction Network, a Pan-Cancer Analysis**
    * 2019-Present
    * This is still an unpublished project.
<br> <br>
  * **Establishing Blood Transfusion waste products as a source of NK cells (Part of M.Sc. Thesis)**
    * 2017-2019
    * Our project was one of several projects carried out by the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization with the primary goal of introducing blood transfusion waste products as a sustainable and economic source of bio-molecules and cells. This is particularly important in under-developed countries where fundings and resources are limited. Methods including flow cytometry, immune cells isolation, ELISA, cell culture, and killing assays were used. NK cells obtained by our method is comparable to peripheral blood&#39;s NK cells in term of viability, Sub-populational composition, and function.
<br> <br>
  * **rbioapi: User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services&#39; API**
    * 2020-2021
    * Open-source R package software
    * Links:
        * [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rbioapi)
        * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moosa-r/rbioapi)
	    * [Documentations Website](https://rbioapi.moosa-r.com/)
    * We developed an R package, _rbioapi_, a consistent, user-friendly, and scalable interface to biological and medical databases and web services. To date, _rbioapi_ fully supports Enrichr, JASPAR, miEAA, PANTHER, Reactome, STRING, and UniProt. We aim to expand this list and make rbioapi as comprehensive as possible. To this end, we developed an infrastructure that facilitates collaborations and the implementation of new services.
<br> <br>
  * **parapurrr: Do purrr in Parallel**
    * 2021
    * Open-source R package software
    * Links:
        * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moosa-r/parapurrr)
    * We developed a simple yet fully customizable way to run functions iteratively in R using multiple CPU cores (instead of the default, one). The package parapurrr achieves that by bridging purrr to foreach package and its adaptors. We added support for all purrr&#39;s map family functions and every foreach adaptor available in CRAN.
